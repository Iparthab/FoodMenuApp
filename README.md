my code has no bug and works. everything my code has is under App.tsx 
This Portfolio of Evidence (POE) represents a significant improvement in my development process, particularly when compared to the challenges faced during Assignment 2.

A primary obstacle in the previous assignment was the inability to establish a stable connection with the Android/iOS emulator. This created a major bottleneck, as it prevented live testing and debugging of the application.

For this POE, I dedicated time to resolving these environment and configuration issues. I am pleased to report that I successfully connected the application to the emulator, enabling a proper development and testing workflow.

Furthermore, I refactored the project's code structure. To simplify the build process and resolve dependencies, I consolidated the core application logic, components, and types into the main app.tsx file. This structural change was instrumental in achieving a stable, runnable build that functioned correctly within the emulator.
